# Cplusplus-Program
For this project, I had created a program for a client "Corner Grocer" that needed a program to read from a list of items purchased throughout the day, and display three options:
A list of all items purchased and how much of each item, an option to look up how much a specific item was purchased, or a histogram that represents the items purchased for
the day. The part that I exceeded in with this project was the menu loop, to be able to display the options, validate input, and clear the screen properly with every loop.
The more challeging part of the code, and the part that could have used more enhancing was the calculations. I used Python to handle most of the analysis, since python has a
built-in function Count(). This will create a dictionary of all the items in a list and count how many times they occur, making this function fairly simple to write. I still 
feel like I could have cleaned up and sone a better job with my Python code, but it still works efficiently with little to no error. This project really illustrates how having 
knowledge of multiple programming languages can really help build a great program, since both languages can build off of eachothers streangths.
